# CoffeeShopSimulator

## Goal
The goal of this simulation is to simulate a coffee shop that may have a variable number of queues and servers, and with a menu of items that have different Poisson-distributed service times. It's not likely, but if the simulation is accurate enough, it could tell baristas what kind of beverages to expect ahead of time as well as whether or not to have one or two servers at certain times for cost optimization.

## Description
M/M/s/n queueing simulation with a menu of Poisson-distributed arrival times
